# Work-Scheduler

This is a Work Scheduling project that allows the user to track various parts of their day by adding content to each time block and hitting the save icon to the side. The time block also correlates to the current hour which allows the user to see what events they have scheduled later in the day, current events they are working on within the hour, and past events that they have completed earlier in the day.
